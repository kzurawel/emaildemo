# emaildemo
An email form with autocomplete

This project creates an `$.autocomplete` plugin and uses it within `email.js`. The plugin is somewhat configurable for use in other projects, but some refactoring would be required to make it truly generic.

I chose jQuery for this project because it allowed me to complete this project in the shortest amount of time possible. I am using lodash for its `_.template` functionality, which could easily be replaced with Handlebars, etc.
